## Business Insights
1. The platform predominantly features content released post-2000, with minimal older titles, presenting an opportunity to cater to senior citizens. <br>
2. Over 80% of Netflix's library consists of mature-rated content (TV-MA, TV-14, TV-PG/PG-13, and R), targeting adult audiences, while the remaining 20% is geared toward children under 13. <br>
3. The most popular genres include international films and series, dramas, comedies, action-adventure, family/kids' content, and thrillers. <br>
4. Approximately 75% of Netflix's catalog originates from just 10 countries, leaving significant room for expansion into untapped markets. <br>
5. Viewers increasingly prefer shorter content, with ideal durations of 75-150 minutes for movies and 1-3 seasons for series—a trend worth considering for future productions. <br>
6. Notably, a decline in new releases was observed globally in 2020–2021, likely due to pandemic-related disruptions. <br>

## Recommandations
1. Currently, Netflix's content library heavily prioritizes a narrow set of genres that primarily cater to Western markets, particularly the US, while overlooking regional preferences in many other countries. For instance, Indian mythological content a highly popular genre in South Asia remains underrepresented, despite its potential for global appeal, much like Japanese anime, which has gained worldwide popularity. To enhance engagement and subscriber growth, Netflix should invest in region-specific genres that resonate deeply with local audiences while also having cross-cultural appeal. <br>
2. Additionally, content ratings and demographic targeting require refinement based on regional population dynamics. In countries like India with a vast and diverse population the platform's current focus on TV-MA, TV-14, and TV-PG-rated content fails to adequately serve key age groups. Younger audiences (under 14) and older demographics (above 35) are largely underserved, despite their significant viewership potential. By analyzing country-specific age distributions and cultural consumption patterns, Netflix can tailor its production strategy to include a broader range of ratings and themes, ensuring inclusivity and maximizing market penetration. <br>
3. A data-driven approach to regional content creation balancing localized storytelling with global scalability could unlock new growth opportunities while strengthening Netflix's position as a truly international entertainment platform.
